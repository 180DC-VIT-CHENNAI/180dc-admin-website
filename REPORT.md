## 1. What Is This Application?

This is the **internal admin website** for **180 Degrees Consulting (180DC) VIT Chennai**. It is a student-run consulting club's complete management platform.

Think of it as a **private workplace tool** (like a company intranet) where:
- **The public** can view the club's website, read blogs, see case studies, and submit consulting requests
- **Members** can log in to manage projects, chat with each other, share files, attend meetings, and handle club operations
- **Board members (leadership)** can manage everything: users, roles, departments, emails, recruitments, and club-wide settings

The entire system runs on cloud infrastructure (Cloudflare) and is accessible at **180dc.shop**.

## 3. Login & Authentication

### How Members Log In
Go to **180dc.shop/members** to access the login page.

**Two login methods:**

1. **Google Sign-In (Recommended)** - Click "Sign in with Google" to log in with your Google account. This is the easiest method. Your Google account must be linked to your club membership first.

2. **Token Login** - Enter your email and your personal access token (a long random string). Board gives you this token when your account is created. If you've lost it, click "Forgot Password?" and your token will be emailed to you.

### How the Token System Works
- Every member gets a **unique access token** (like a password, but much longer and more secure)
- This token is your key to log in - treat it like a password
- Board can create, revoke, or rotate tokens at any time
- Tokens can expire after a set time
- If your token is compromised, board can instantly revoke it and issue a new one

### Linking Google Account
- Once logged in, you can link your Google account from the Profile page
- After linking, you can use "Sign in with Google" for future logins
- You can disconnect Google at any time from Profile

### Forgot Token
- Click "Forgot Password?" on the login page
- Enter your email address
- Your token will be emailed to you (if your account exists)

### Dual Role Login
- Some members have two roles (e.g., a Technical Lead who is also a Director)
- When logging in, you'll be asked to choose which role you want to use for this session
- This determines what you can see and do in the dashboard

### Session Expiry
- Sessions last for a set period
- If your session expires, a red banner appears at the top: "Your session has expired. Please log in again."
- You'll be redirected to the login page

### Auto-Logout
- If inactive for 7 days, you're automatically logged out for security
