# Implementation Plan — 180DC VIT Chennai Platform

This plan describes the target state and a safe path to reach it. It is not a fixed schedule; it is a dependency map for agents and maintainers.

## Target state

The platform should have:

1. A clean separation of concerns:
   - `admin-api` continues to serve the members portal and admin functions.
   - `public-api` becomes a dedicated public API (newsletter, consulting, content, completed projects).
   - `job-processor` becomes a real queue consumer for email batching, bulk operations, and background tasks.
2. A proper database package with versioned, non-destructive migrations.
3. A unit and integration test suite.
4. Amazon SES for bulk newsletter sends with Resend as fallback.
5. A documented public API surface and stable environment contracts.
6. Reduced single-file size of `apps/admin-api/index.ts` by splitting into routers/modules.

## Current state prerequisites

Before any large restructuring, all existing code and data must be preserved:

- Token-based auth in `admin_tokens`.
- D1 schema in `apps/admin-api/index.ts`.
- R2 keys and bucket names.
- Public routes used by the frontend landing page.
- Frontend `sessionStorage` and `localStorage` keys.
- Wrangler bindings and route patterns.

## Migration roadmap

### Phase 0 — Stabilize documentation and tests

- Keep all existing behavior.
- Add documentation (`AGENTS.md`, this tree).
- Add a minimal test harness and a few integration tests for critical paths (login, rate limits, email quota).

### Phase 1 — Safe schema and code hygiene

- Remove or replace `packages/db/schema.sql` with a migration directory that matches `admin-api/index.ts`.
- Split `apps/admin-api/index.ts` into logical modules (auth, members, projects, meets, newsletter, etc.) without changing routes.
- Add a central route table and auth map.

### Phase 2 — Public API extraction

- Move public endpoints to `apps/public-api/index.ts`.
- Add `wrangler.toml` routes for `public-api`.
- Update `apps/frontend/functions/_middleware.ts` to route public calls to `public-api` while preserving the current `admin-api` proxy for a compatibility window.
- Add compatibility contract tests.

### Phase 3 — Job processor

- Replace `queueOrSendMeetEmails` pending/D1 approach with real Queue messages.
- Implement `job-processor` to consume meet and bulk email jobs.
- Add retry logic and dead-letter handling.

### Phase 4 — Bulk email with Amazon SES

- Implement `architecture/NEWSLETTER_BULK_SEND_DECISION.md`.
- Add SES credentials and sender domain.
- Keep Resend as transactional fallback.

### Phase 5 — Continuous improvement

- Add comprehensive tests.
- Refactor frontend to consume new public API cleanly.
- Introduce a shared validation library.

## Exit criteria per phase

| Phase | Done when |
|-------|-----------|
| 0 | Docs merged; at least three critical integration tests pass in CI. |
| 1 | `packages/db/schema.sql` replaced; `admin-api` split into modules; all existing routes still pass. |
| 2 | `public-api` serves public routes; `admin-api` still proxies them during the transition; no frontend breakage. |
| 3 | Queue producer sends messages; `job-processor` consumes and sends emails; `pending_emails` table can be deprecated. |
| 4 | Newsletter bulk send uses SES with Resend fallback; feature flag controlled. |
| 5 | 80% of API endpoints covered by automated tests; frontend uses new public API. |

## Risk register

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Splitting `admin-api/index.ts` introduces regressions | Do it module by module; keep the same Hono app and route strings; add contract tests before and after. |
| Moving public routes to `public-api` breaks the landing page | Keep `admin-api` public endpoints as deprecated aliases for one release; test all landing-page fetches. |
| Schema changes break deployed D1 | Every migration is idempotent and `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN` in a `try/catch`; never drop columns/tables used by current code. |
| Email quota changes cause missed notifications | Implement queue + job processor before changing email provider; preserve 100/day cap logic. |
| Losing `admin_tokens` state | Tokens are D1 rows; keep the table and auth middleware intact across all phases. |

## Current branch strategy

- `main` remains deployable at all times.
- Feature work for each phase should happen on a dedicated branch and be merged via pull request.
- Documentation updates (like this tree) live on `docs/agent-first` and merge first.
