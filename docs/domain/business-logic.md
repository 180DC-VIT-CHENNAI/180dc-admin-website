# Business Logic — 180DC VIT Chennai Platform

This document describes the system from the domain perspective. Each section covers a capability, its actors, rules, and state changes.

## Authentication and sessions

### Actors
- Public visitor.
- Member with a token.
- Member with Clerk Google OAuth.

### Workflows

#### Token login (RULE-AUTH-01)

1. User provides a token at `/members`.
2. Frontend posts `POST /api/dev-login`.
3. Backend validates the token against `admin_tokens`.
4. If the token is not revoked and not expired, the user is looked up by email in `users`.
5. If no user exists, the backend auto-creates a user from the token's `email`, `name`, and `role_id`.
6. The response includes `email`, `name`, `roleId`, `roleName`, `powerLevel`, and `departmentId`.
7. Frontend stores the token and profile in `sessionStorage` and `localStorage`.

#### Clerk Google login (RULE-AUTH-02)

1. User clicks Google sign-in; Clerk handles OAuth.
2. Frontend gets a Clerk JWT via `getToken()`.
3. Frontend posts `POST /api/auth/clerk-login` with the JWT and email.
4. Backend verifies the JWT with `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`.
5. Backend looks up the user by `clerk_user_id` or by email (auto-link if found).
6. If `oauth_enabled = 0`, login fails.
7. A token is created or reused in `admin_tokens`.
8. Frontend uses that token for subsequent requests.

#### Token rotation (RULE-AUTH-03)

- Any authenticated member can rotate their own token via `POST /api/auth/rotate-token`.
- The old token is deleted; a new token is generated and emailed.

#### Link/unlink Clerk (RULE-AUTH-04)

- Authenticated members can link a Clerk user ID via `POST /api/auth/link-clerk`.
- They can unlink via `POST /api/auth/unlink-clerk`.

### Business rules

- RULE-AUTH-01: A token must be unrevoked and unexpired to log in.
- RULE-AUTH-02: Google login only works if the user has `oauth_enabled = 1`.
- RULE-AUTH-03: Tokens are deleted and regenerated on rotation, not stored hashed.
- RULE-AUTH-04: The `forgot-token` endpoint always returns success to prevent email enumeration.
- RULE-AUTH-05: Maintenance mode blocks all members with `power_level < 100`.

## Roles and permissions

### Actors
- System (seeded roles).
- Board member (`power_level >= 100`).
- Director (`power_level = 50`).
- General member (`power_level = 10`).
- Advisory member (`power_level = 30`).

### State

- `roles(id, name, power_level, created_by)`.
- `users(id, name, email, role_id, department_id, secondary_role_id, ex_title, clerk_user_id, oauth_enabled, created_at)`.

### Business rules

- RULE-ROLE-01: System seeds board roles with `power_level = 100`, director roles with `power_level = 50`, `member` with `10`, and `advisory` with `30`.
- RULE-ROLE-02: Custom roles can only be created with `power_level < 100`.
- RULE-ROLE-03: Board members can create/assign roles and departments.
- RULE-ROLE-04: Directors can only manage users and meets in their own department.
- RULE-ROLE-05: Advisory members cannot be added to team instances.
- RULE-ROLE-06: Board members cannot be deleted.
- RULE-ROLE-07: When a member's role is changed via `/api/members/:id/role`, a role-change email is sent.

### Role transfer workflow

1. Board creates a transfer from user A to user B for role R.
2. If both A and B accept (`/api/my-role-transfers/:id/accept`), the system assigns R to B and `member` to A.
3. Board can approve or reject via `/api/role-transfers/:id/approve` or `/reject`.
4. Board-level roles (`power_level = 100`) cannot be transferred.

## Member lifecycle

### Workflows

#### Add member (RULE-MEMBER-01)

- Board uses `POST /api/members` to add a new general member.
- A user is created with `role_id = 'member'`.
- Any prior `admin_tokens` row for that email is deleted.
- A new token is generated and emailed.

#### Add board user (RULE-MEMBER-02)

- Board uses `POST /api/board-users`.
- The target role must have `power_level >= 50`.
- If the email already exists, the user is updated.
- A token is generated and emailed.

#### Add advisory member (RULE-MEMBER-03)

- Board uses `POST /api/advisory-members`.
- The user is created or updated with `role_id = 'advisory'`.
- An optional `ex_title` and `department_id` can be set.
- A token is generated and emailed.

#### Approve signup request (RULE-MEMBER-04)

- Public user submits `POST /api/signup-requests`.
- Board sees pending requests.
- On approval, a user is created as `role_id = 'member'` in the requested department.
- A token is generated and emailed.

#### Remove member (RULE-MEMBER-05)

- Board uses `DELETE /api/members/:id`.
- Board members cannot be removed.
- Related `admin_tokens` and `role_transfers` are cleaned up.

## Departments

### Actors
- Board (can manage all).
- Director (can manage own department).
- Member (can view own department).

### State

- `departments(id, name, description)`.

## Meets

### Types

- Club-wide (`club_meets`): all members.

### Actors

- Board can create all meet types.
- Directors can create department meets for their own department.
- Requirement for creating club-wide or inter-department meets is `power_level >= 50` in code, not strictly board.
