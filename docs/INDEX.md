## Task-based context routers

### Adding or changing an API endpoint

1. `docs/product/product-spec.md` — confirm the capability and actor.
2. `docs/domain/business-logic.md` — find the domain rules for the area.
3. `docs/domain/invariants.md` — identify invariants that may be affected.
4. `docs/contracts/api-contract.md` — add or update the route.
5. `docs/contracts/data-model.md` — update if persistence changes.
6. `docs/compatibility/compatibility-contracts.md` — if the route is public or used by clients.
7. `apps/admin-api/index.ts` — implement.

### Changing the database schema

1. `docs/contracts/data-model.md` — current schema.
2. `docs/domain/invariants.md` — integrity constraints.
3. `apps/admin-api/index.ts` — `ensureTables` and `runMigrations` are the canonical schema source.
4. `docs/execution/implementation-plan.md` — migration/backfill plan if existing data is affected.
5. `docs/contracts/api-contract.md` — affected endpoints.
6. `docs/compatibility/compatibility-contracts.md` — compatibility window.

### Changing authentication or authorization

1. `docs/product/product-spec.md` — actors and roles.
2. `docs/domain/business-logic.md` — auth flows.
3. `docs/domain/invariants.md` — auth invariants.
4. `docs/contracts/api-contract.md` — auth column for all routes.
5. `docs/architecture/system-architecture.md` — trust boundaries.
6. `docs/compatibility/compatibility-contracts.md` — token and Clerk compatibility.

### Changing the frontend

1. `DESIGN.md` and `frontend-design/plan.md` — visual and UX constraints.
2. `docs/product/product-spec.md` — relevant capability.
3. `docs/domain/business-logic.md` — workflow.
4. `docs/contracts/api-contract.md` — routes the UI calls.
5. `apps/frontend/` — implement.

### Refactoring existing backend code

1. `docs/execution/current-state.md` — current implementation notes and hazards.
2. `docs/architecture/system-architecture.md` — component responsibilities.
3. `docs/domain/invariants.md` — rules that must survive refactoring.
4. `docs/quality/testing-strategy.md` — add characterization tests if coverage is weak.
5. `apps/admin-api/index.ts` — refactor.

### Replacing a subsystem (e.g., public-api or job-processor)

1. `docs/execution/current-state.md` — why it is a placeholder.
2. `docs/architecture/system-architecture.md` — current and target architecture.
3. `docs/contracts/api-contract.md` — affected contracts.
4. `docs/execution/implementation-plan.md` — migration plan.
5. `docs/compatibility/compatibility-contracts.md` — compatibility requirements.
6. `docs/quality/testing-strategy.md` — verification strategy.

### Changing infrastructure or deployment

1. `docs/architecture/system-architecture.md` — topology.
2. `docs/operations/deployment.md` — build and deploy commands.
3. `apps/*/wrangler.toml` — current bindings and routes.
4. `docs/execution/implementation-plan.md` — rollout order.

## Stable identifiers used across documents

| Prefix | Meaning |
