# 🌐 Environment Variables

Each Worker may require its own environment configuration.

For local development, create a `.dev.vars` file inside `apps/admin-api`:

```env
RESEND_API_KEY=re_...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
ENVIRONMENT=development
```

For the frontend, create `apps/frontend/.env.local`:

```env
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8787
```

For production, store secrets securely using Wrangler:

```bash
wrangler secret put RESEND_API_KEY
wrangler secret put CLERK_SECRET_KEY
```

See `docs/operations/deployment.md` for full environment setup.
